\section{Background}
%=============================================================================
\begin{slide}{Symmetric ciphers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A symmetric cipher is a cipher that uses the same key for both
    encryption and decryption.
  \item Two parties communicating using a symmetric cipher must agree
    on the key beforehand.
  \item Once they agree, the sender encrypts a message using the key,
    sends it to the receiver, and the receiver decrypts the message
    using the key.
  \item Examples: ROT13, 3DES, Blowfish, IDEA.
  \item Advantage: hard to crack, provided the key is big enough (128 bits is
    standard).
  \item Disadvantage: How to securely communicate the key?
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Public-key ciphers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Uses a pair of keys:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{public key} is given to anyone who wishes to
      communicate and is used to encrypt a message.
    \item The \textbf{private key} is kept secret and is used to
      decrypt a message.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Advantage: simplified key exchange.
  \item Disadvantage: easier to crack, so key sizes must be much
    larger (1024 bits is standard).
  \item \textbf{Hybrid ciphers} combine elements of both symmetric
    and public-key encryption.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Digital signatures}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A document's digital signature is the result of applying a
    one-way hash function to the document.
  \item The hash is then encrypted using the signer's \textbf{private
      key}.
  \item To verify the signature, the recipient decrypts the hash using
    the signer's \textbf{public key}.
  \item If the decrypted hash value matches the actual hash value of
    the document (as calculated by the recipient), then the recipient
    can be sure that the document he has received was exactly the same
    one the signer sent.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Web of trust}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When you have faith that a certain public key belongs to a
    certain person, you can add your digital signature to that public
    key and then republish it.
  \item However, it would be awkward for you to have to personally
    verify and sign every single public key you encounter.
  \item GnuPG addresses this problem with a mechanism popularly known
    as the \textbf{web of trust}.
  \item In the web of trust model, responsibility for validating
    public keys is delegated to people you trust.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%=============================================================================
\section{Why use GnuPG at DFKI?}
%=============================================================================
\begin{slide}{Software distribution}
  If you distribute software on the Internet, there are many reasons
  to digitally sign your packages:\\[1ex]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item packages cannot be tampered with without breaking the signature
  \item corrupted downloads will break the signature
  \item encapsulated signatures are supported and encouraged by many
    popular archive and packaging formats (\eg RPM)
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Authenticating e-mail}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item By making it a policy of yours to always sign important
    e-mails, you can prevent e-mails from being forged in your name.
  \item By insisting that your colleagues always sign their e-mails,
    you can always be sure you know who you're communicating with.
  \item Signing e-mails prevents deniability---if you receive a signed
    document from someone, they cannot later claim that they did not
    send it.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Encrypting e-mail}
  Encrypting e-mail containing proposals, results, and publication
  drafts reduces the following risks:\\[1ex]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item sensitive communications intercepted by or leaked to press
  \item research results stolen and published by unscrupulous
    colleagues or students
  \item corporate espionage on important projects with business
    research partners
  \item confidential customer/client information is leaked; customers
    sue DFKI for invasion of privacy
  \item private documents accidentally sent to wrong e-mail address
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Protecting personal data}
  GnuPG's symmetric-key encryption can be used to protect sensitive
  documents stored on your computer.  For instance:\\[1ex]
  \begin{itemize}
  \item experiment results
  \item personal data on experiment volunteers
  \item password lists
  \item bank and credit card statements
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%=============================================================================

%=============================================================================
\section{Acquiring the software}
%=============================================================================

\begin{slide}{GnuPG \vs PGP \vs OpenPGP}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item PGP was first developed and freely released by Phil Zimmerman
  \item PGP later commercialized; now a proprietary system
  \item encryption method standardized as OpenPGP
  \item GnuPG is GNU's free implementation of the OpenPGP standard
  \item other implementations of OpenPGP exist, but GnuPG is free and
    popular
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Installing GnuPG}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item download from \url{http://www.gnupg.org/}
  \item compile from source or fetch a binary package for a supported
    system:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item GNU/Linux
    \item Mac OS X
    \item Unix (POSIX-compliant)
    \item Microsoft Windows
    \end{itemize}
  \item GUIs are available, but an understanding of the underlying
    command-line version is important
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%=============================================================================
\section{Managing keys}
%=============================================================================

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Generating a new keypair}
  All GnuPG functions are invoked through the \texttt{gpg} command.
  The command-line option \clopt{-gen-key} is used to create a new
  primary keypair:\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --gen-key
gpg (GnuPG) 1.2.6; Copyright (C) 2004 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions. See the file COPYING for details.

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) DSA and ElGamal (default)
   (2) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct,toc=]{Generating a new keypair}
  DSA keys are always 1024 bits.  For ElGamal keys, you must specify a
  key size.  The default key size of 1024 bits is appropriate for most
  users. (2048 bits is too slow and produces overly large
  signatures; 768 bits is too easy to crack.)\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
DSA keypair will have 1024 bits.
About to generate a new ELG-E keypair.
              minimum keysize is  768 bits
              default keysize is 1024 bits
    highest suggested keysize is 2048 bits
What keysize do you want? (1024) 
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct,toc=]{Generating a new keypair}
  Next, you must choose an expiration date. For most users a key
  that does not expire is adequate.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0)
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct,toc=]{Generating a new keypair}
  You must now provide a user ID.  (It is possible to add additional
  user IDs later in case you want to use the key in two or more
  contexts.) A user ID should be created carefully since it cannot be
  edited after it is created.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
You need a User-ID to identify your key; the software constructs the
user id from Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: Frettchen Rättchen
Email address: frettchen@dfki.de
Comment: Haustier
You are using the `iso-8859-1' character set.
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Frettchen Rättchen (Haustier) <frettchen@dfki.de>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit?
\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct,toc=]{Generating a new keypair}
Finally, you must enter a passphrase to protect your private key.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
You need a Passphrase to protect your private key.    

Enter passphrase: 

\end{verbatim}
Because this password protects access to your PGP identity, it should
be carefully chosen.  It must be long enough to be secure, but also
easy for you to remember and type.\\[1ex]

At \url{http://www.diceware.com/} you will find a method of generating
long but easy-to-remember passwords by combining five English or
German words.\\[1ex]

Example: \texttt{distel ist landen kammer puffen}
\end{slide}

\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\tiny\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Your public keyring}
  Your \textbf{keyring} is a list of all public keys you have
  generated or imported.  You can view it with the
  \clopt{-list-keys} option:\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --list-keys
pub  1024D/B935225F 2005-01-27 Frettchen Rättchen (Haustier) <frettchen@dfki.de>
sub  1024g/4DE87B5A 2005-01-27

pub  1024D/EFBF4915 2003-10-24 Tristan Miller (Research scientist) <tristan.miller@dfki.de>

sub  1024g/B40BE860 2003-10-24

\end{verbatim}%$
  Most command-line arguments dealing with keys let you specify a
  particular key or set of keys.  You can use the key's ID or any part
  of the user ID.  For example:\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --list-keys Tristan
pub  1024D/EFBF4915 2003-10-24 Tristan Miller (Research scientist) <tristan.miller@dfki.de>
uid                            Tristan Miller <psychonaut@nothingisreal.com>
sub  1024g/B40BE860 2003-10-24

\end{verbatim}%$
\end{slide}

\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\tiny\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Generating a revocation certificate}
  If you forget your passphrase or if your private key is compromised
  or lost, a \textbf{revocation certificate} may be published to
  notify others that the public key should no longer be used.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --output revoke.asc --gen-revoke Frettchen

sec  1024D/B935225F 2005-01-27   Frettchen Rättchen (Haustier) <frettchen@dfki.de>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision?

\end{verbatim}%$

The revocation certificate should be printed out and stored in a safe
place.
\end{slide}

\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\scriptsize\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Exporting a public key}
To communicate with others you must exchange public keys.  To export a
public key on your keyring, use the \clopt{-export} option.  By
default, keys are exported as binary data, but you can specify an
ASCII encoding using the \clopt{-armor} option.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --armor --export Frettchen

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Importing a public key}
  Most people publish their public key on their web page.  A public
  key may be added to your public keyring with the \clopt{-import}
  option. You can either specify a filename or paste from the
  clipboard into stdin.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --import walter.gpg
gpg: key 85C62E2D: public key imported

\end{verbatim}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Validating a key}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Once a key is imported, it should be validated.
  \item Sometimes a key may be automatically validated by virtue of a
    chain of trust.
  \item You may need to personally validate some keys.  This entails
    the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Verify the key's fingerprint with the owner.
    \item Sign the key to certify it as valid.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

%\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\tiny\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Verifying a key}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A key's fingerprint is verified with the key's owner.
  \item This may be done in person or over the phone or through any
    other means as long as you can \emph{guarantee} that you are
    communicating with the key's true owner.
  \item If the fingerprint you get is the same as the fingerprint the
    key's owner gets, then you can be sure that you have a correct
    copy of the key.
  \item Use the \clopt{-fingerprint} option to retrieve a key's
    fingerprint.
  \end{itemize}

\begin{verbatim}

[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --fingerprint Walter
pub  1024D/85C62E2D 2000-02-23 Walter Sommer <sommer@dfki.uni-kl.de>

\end{verbatim}%$
\end{slide}

\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\tiny\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Signing a key}
  After checking the fingerprint, you may \textbf{sign} the key to
  validate it.  Since key verification is a weak point in public-key
  cryptography, you should be extremely careful and always check a
  key's fingerprint with the owner before signing the key.\\[1ex]
\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --sign-key Walter

\end{verbatim}%$
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Listing key signatures}
  Signatures are incorporated into a public key, and are distributed
  with it.  Once signed you can check the key to list the signatures
  on it and see the signature that you have added. Every user ID on
  the key will have one or more self-signatures as well as a signature
  for each user that has validated the key.\\[1ex]

\begin{verbatim}
[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --check-sigs Walter
pub  1024D/85C62E2D 2000-02-23 Walter Sommer <sommer@dfki.uni-kl.de>

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Public key servers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Most people publish their public key on their web page.
  \item However, not everyone has a web page, or knows where to find
    yours.
  \item To solve this problem \textbf{public key servers} are used to
    collect and distribute public keys.
  \item A public key received by the server is either added to the
    server's database or merged with the existing key if already
    present.
  \item When a key request comes to the server, the server consults
    its database and returns the requested public key if found.
  \item There are several popular keyservers in use around the world.
    The major ones synchronize themselves regularly, so you can just
    pick one for your general use.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct,toc=]{Public key servers}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item You can send and receive keys to/from keyservers with the
    \clopt{-send-key} and \clopt{-recv-key} options.  You also need to
    specify which keyserver using the \clopt{-keyserver} option.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}

[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --keyserver wwwkeys.eu.pgp.net --send-key Walter

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Encrypting a document}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To encrypt a document the option \clopt{-encrypt} is used.
  \item You must have the public keys of the intended recipients, whom
    you specify with the \clopt{-recipient} option.
  \item GnuPG expects the name of the document to encrypt as input; if
    omitted, it reads standard input.
  \item The encrypted result is placed on standard output or as
    specified using the option \clopt{-output}.
  \item The document is automatically compressed before encryption.
  \item Remember to include yourself as a recipient if you want to be
    able to decrypt and view the document!

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Decrypting a document}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item To decrypt a message the option \clopt{-decrypt} is used.
  \item You need the private key to which the message was encrypted.
  \item The document to decrypt is input, and the decrypted result is
    output.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}

[sommer@serv-3100:~]$ gpg --output doc.txt --decrypt doc.gpg

\end{slide}

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Symmetric encryption}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Documents may also be encrypted with a symmetric cipher
    instead of public-key cryptography.
  \item The symmetric cipher offers higher security, but should only
    be used when the passphrase does not need to be communicated to
    others.
  \item Documents can be encrypted with the \clopt{-symmetric} option
    and decrypted as usual with \clopt{-decrypt}.
  \end{itemize}

\section{Authentication}
%=============================================================================

\begin{slide}{Signing a document}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item A digital signature certifies and timestamps a document.
  \item If the document is subsequently modified in any way, a
    verification of the signature will fail.
  \item A digital signature can serve the same purpose as a
    hand-written signature with the additional benefit of being
    tamper-resistant.
  \item Software distributions are signed so that users who download
    them can verify that they have not been modified since they were
    packaged.
  \item E-mails are signed so that the recipient can verify that the
    message has not been forged or altered.
  \item There are two common ways of producing a signature:
    clearsigning and detatched signatures
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\makeatletter\renewcommand{\verbatim@font}{\tiny\tt}\makeatother
\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Clearsigned documents}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The option \clopt{-clearsign} causes a text document to be
    wrapped in an ASCII-armored signature.
  \item Clearsigning is used most often for e-mail messages and Usenet
    postings.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}

[psy@port-3108:~]$ echo "Hello, world!" >hello.txt

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Detached signatures}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Clearsigned documents have two limitations:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Clearsigning is appropriate only for text documents.
    \item To obtain the original version, the document must be edited
      to remove the signature.
    \end{itemize}
  \item It is therefore possible to output a signature to a separate
    file, leaving the original document intact.
  \item For this the \clopt{--detach-sig} option is used.
  \end{itemize}
\begin{verbatim}

[psy@port-3108:~]$ gpg --armor --output hello.sig --detach-sig hello.txt

\begin{slide}[method=direct]{Verifying signatures}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Given a signed document and a public key, you can check the

\begin{slide}{Trust model}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item In practice trust is subjective.
  \item For example, Blake's key is valid to Alice since she signed
    it, but she may not trust Blake to properly validate keys that he
    signs.
  \item The web of trust model accounts for this by associating with
    each public key on your keyring an indication of how much you
    trust the key's owner:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item unknown
    \item none
    \item marginal
    \item full
    \end{itemize}
  \item A key's trust level is something that you alone assign to the
    key, and it is considered private information.
  \item It is not packaged with the key when it is exported; it is
    even stored separately from your keyrings in a separate database.
  \end{itemize}
\end{slide}

Please decide how far you trust this user to correctly
verify other users' keys (by looking at passports,
checking fingerprints from different sources...)?

 1 = Don't know
 2 = I do NOT trust
 3 = I trust marginally
 4 = I trust fully
 5 = I trust ultimately
 m = back to the main menu

Your decision?

\begin{slide}{Using trust to validate keys}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Formerly, a key was considered valid only if you signed it
    personally.
  \item Now we have a revised model.  A key $K$ is considered valid if
    it meets two conditions:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item It is signed by enough valid keys, meaning
      \begin{itemize}
      \item you have signed it personally, or
      \item it has been signed by one fully trusted key, or
      \item it has been signed by three marginally trusted keys; and
      \end{itemize}
    \item the path of signed keys leading from $K$ back to your own
      key is five steps or shorter.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{itemize}

\begin{slide}{E-mail integration}
  Many e-mail clients now support digital signatures.  For each e-mail
  account, you can associate a public key for signing and encryption.
