# GnuPG for Beginners

This project contains slides for "GnuPG for Beginners", a tutorial
presented by Tristan Miller at the
[UKP Lab](http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/)'s SigDEV presentation
series on August 16, 2016.  The slides have been adapted from
"Introduction to GnuPG", a tutorial presented by Tristan Miller at the
Knowledge Management Department of the
[German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](http://www.dfki.de/)
on January 28, 2005.

The slides use the Powerdot presentation class, and must be compiled
using latex + dvips + ps2pdf.  (Using pdflatex, xelatex, etc. will not
work.)
