# GnuPG for Beginners

This project contains slides for "GnuPG for Beginners", a tutorial presented
by Tristan Miller at the UKP Lab's
[SigDEV presentation series](https://wiki.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/bin/viewauth/DKPro/SigDEVPresentations)
on August 16, 2016.  The slides have been adapted from "Introduction to GnuPG", a tutorial presented by Tristan Miller at the Knowledge Management Department of the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence on January 28, 2005.

The slides use the Powerdot presentation class, and must be compiled using latex + dvips + ps2pdf.  (Using pdflatex, xelatex, etc. will not work.)
