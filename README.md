# GnuPG for Beginners

This project contains slides for "GnuPG for Beginners", a tutorial
presented by [Tristan Miller](https://logological.org/) at the
Research Studios Austria FG Learning Labs on 13 and 20 July, 2023. The
slides have been adapted from "Introduction to GnuPG", a tutorial
presented by Tristan Miller at the Knowledge Management Department of
the [German Research Center for Artificial
Intelligence](http://www.dfki.de/) on January 28, 2005.

The slides use the Powerdot presentation class, and must be compiled
using `latex` + `dvips` + `ps2pdf`.  (Using `pdflatex`, `xelatex`,
etc. will not work.)
