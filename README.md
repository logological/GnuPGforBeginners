# GnuPG for Beginners

This project contains slides for "GnuPG for Beginners", a tutorial
presented by [Tristan Miller](https://logological.org/) for the
Winterophase 2016 workshops at Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt's
Department of Computer Science on October 13, 2016.  The slides have
been adapted from "Introduction to GnuPG", a tutorial presented by
Tristan Miller at the Knowledge Management Department of the
[German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](http://www.dfki.de/)
on January 28, 2005.

The slides use the Powerdot presentation class, and must be compiled
using `latex` + `dvips` + `ps2pdf`.  (Using `pdflatex`, `xelatex`,
etc. will not work.)
