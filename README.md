# GnuPG for Beginners

This project contains slides for "GnuPG for Beginners", a tutorial by
[Tristan Miller](https://logological.org/).  Versions of the tutorial
have been presented at:

* the Winterophase 2016 workshops at Technische Universität
Darmstadt's Department of Computer Science on October 13, 2016 (see
the
[TUDAOphase_20161013 branch](https://github.com/logological/GnuPGforBeginners/tree/TUDAOphase_20161013))
* the SigDEV presentation series at Technische Universität Darmstadt's
  Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab on August 16, 2016
* the Knowledge Management Department of the
[German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](http://www.dfki.de/)
on January 28, 2005 (see the
[UKPSigDev_20160816 branch](https://github.com/logological/GnuPGforBeginners/tree/UKPSigDev_20160816))

The slides use the Powerdot presentation class, and must be compiled
using `latex` + `dvips` + `ps2pdf`.  (Using `pdflatex`, `xelatex`,
etc. will not work.)
